## Initialization

import sigmoid as sig
import costFunction as cf
import predict as pr
import plotData as pd
import plotDecisionBoundary as pdb
import numpy as np 
from scipy.optimize import fmin
from scipy.optimize import fmin_bfgs

## Load Data
#  The first two columns contains the exam scores and the third column
#  contains the label.

data = np.loadtxt('ex2data1.txt', delimiter=",")
X = data[:,:2]
y = data[:,2]

## ==================== Part 1: Plotting ====================
#  We start the exercise by first plotting the data to understand the 
#  the problem we are working with.

print('Plotting data with + indicating (y = 1) examples and o indicating (y = 0) examples.')

plt, p1, p2 = pd.plotData(X, y)

# # Labels and Legend
plt.xlabel('Exam 1 score')
plt.ylabel('Exam 2 score')
plt.legend((p1, p2), ('Admitted', 'Not Admitted'), numpoints=1, handlelength=0)

plt.show(block=False) # prevents having to close the graph to move forward with ex2.py

input('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n')
# plt.close()

## ============ Part 2: Compute Cost and Gradient ============
#  In this part of the exercise, you will implement the cost and gradient
#  for logistic regression. You neeed to complete the code in 
#  costFunction.m

#  Setup the data matrix appropriately, and add ones for the intercept term
m,n = X.shape
X_padded = np.column_stack((np.ones((m,1)), X)) 

# Initialize fitting parameters
initial_theta = np.zeros((n + 1, 1))

# Compute and display initial cost and gradient
cost, grad = cf.costFunction(initial_theta, X_padded, y, return_grad=True)

print('Cost at initial theta (zeros): {:f}'.format(cost))
print('Gradient at initial theta (zeros):')
print(grad)

input('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n')


## ============= Part 3: Optimizing using fmin (and fmin_bfgs)  =============
#  In this exercise, you will use a built-in function (fmin) to find the
#  optimal parameters theta.

#  Run fmin and fmin_bfgs to obtain the optimal theta
#  This function will return theta and the cost 
#  fmin followed by fmin_bfgs inspired by stackoverflow.com/a/23089696/583834
#  overkill... but wanted to use fmin_bfgs, and got error if used first
myargs=(X_padded, y)
theta = fmin(cf.costFunction, x0=initial_theta, args=myargs)
theta, cost_at_theta, _, _, _, _, _ = fmin_bfgs(cf.costFunction, x0=theta, args=myargs, full_output=True)

# Print theta to screen
print('Cost at theta found by fmin: {:f}'.format(cost_at_theta))
print('theta:'),
print(theta)

# Plot Boundary
pdb.plotDecisionBoundary(theta, X_padded, y)

plt.hold(False) # prevents further drawing on plot
plt.show(block=False) 

input('Program paused. Press enter to continue.\n')


## ============== Part 4: Predict and Accuracies ==============
#  After learning the parameters, you'll like to use it to predict the outcomes
#  on unseen data. In this part, you will use the logistic regression model
#  to predict the probability that a student with the score getting on
#  exam 1 and on exam 2 will be admitted.
#  Furthermore, you will compute the training and test set accuracies of 
#  our model.
#
#  Predict probability for a student with given score on exam 1 
#  and exam 2 
sc1=int(input("Program paused. Enter the score of Exam 1 : "))
sc2=int(input("Program paused. Enter the score of Exam 2 : "))
prob = sig.sigmoid(np.dot(np.array([1,sc1,sc2]),theta))
print('For a student with scores {} and {}, we predict an admission probability of {:f}'.format(sc1,sc2,prob))

# Compute accuracy on our training set
p = pr.predict(theta, X_padded)

print('Train Accuracy: {:f}'.format(np.mean(p == y) * 100))
